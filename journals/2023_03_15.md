	- techniques for creating proofs
		- blind signatures
		- accumulators
		- pedersen commitments
		- [[sigma protocol]]s
			- advantages
				- very economical for small circuits
				- do not require a truste dsetup
				- security assumptions are weak and are well understood
				- maths is fairly easy to understand
			- disadvantages
				- do not scale  well
					- proof size, proof generation, and verification size are linear in the complexity of the statement
					- cannot easily handle generic computation, they are better suited for algebraic constructions
	- broad advantages of snarks
		- small proof size
		- fast verification
		- generic approach
	- drawbacks of snarks
		- require a [[trusted setup]]
		- very long [[proving key]]s
		- proof generation is impractical on constrained devices
		- strong security assumptions haven't been well tested
		- theoretical background is difficult to understand
- zkp usecases
	- other projects
		- [[Tornado Cash]]
		- [[Filecoin]]
		- [[Dark Forest]]
