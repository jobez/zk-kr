- zero knowledge works with restricted set of [[integers]]
- [[fields]] are relevant and represent a finite field of integers mod p with multiplicative inverses
- finite fields are used for cryptography

	- Quote from Vitalik Buterin
	  "You can make a proof for the statement "I know a secret number such that if you take the word â€˜cow', add the number to the end, and SHA256 hash it 100 million times, the output starts with 0x57d00485aa ". The verifier can verify the proof far more quickly than it would take for them to run 100 million hashes themselves, and the proof would also not reveal what the secret number is."
