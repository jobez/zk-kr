- rollups require [[operators]]
	- to stake a bond in the rollup contract
- this incentivises operators to verify and execute correctly
- [[data availability]]
- transaction compression and costs
	- for [[zkp rollups]] it is expensive to verify the [[validity proof]]
	- for starks this costs ~5 million gas,
		- which aggregated is about
			- 384 gas cost per transaction
			- due to compression techniques
				- [[calldata cost]] is only 86 gas
					- this is further reduced by the calldata EIP448 to 16.1 gas
	- the batch cost is poly-log
		- so if
			- activity increases 100x
		- the batch cost will decrease to 4-5 gas per transaction
			- in which case
				- the calldata reduction would have a huge impact
	- at 100x the tps today on dYDyX
		- the total on-chain cost will reduce to only 21 gas
		- at this point,
			- the bottleneck becomes prover costs for the rollup as much as on chain gas fees
- approaches to zkrollups on ethereum
	- building [[application specific circuit]]
		- although this can be fairly generic as in [[starknet]]
	- building a universal evm circuit for smart contract execution
		- the opcode of the evm needs to interact with
			- stack
			- memory
			- storage
	- [[zkevm]]
		- [[zksync]]
