- what is the relationship between a [[transaction]], a [[block]], and a [[sequencer]]?
	- In the StarkNet protocol, the sequencers are responsible for ordering the transactions and producing blocks.
	- After the block
		- is
			- created by
				- a sequencer,
			- and approved by
				- the consensus protocol,
		- the [[prover]] s take over and generate a proof for l1
	- When a transaction is submitted (by a user) in StarkNet, it goes to a sequencer node.
	- The [[sequencer]]
		- takes
			- batches of transactions
		- and generates
			- two things:
				- A list of changes caused by all the transactions in the batch (changes in storage, balances, etc)
				- an [[execution trace]]
					- that represents
						- the sequence of transactions that were included in a block
					- which is then used to generate
						- A [[proof]]Â that,
							- if
								- all transactions included in the batch
									- are executed successfully against
										- the previous state of the network,
							- the result will be the list of changes listed before.
