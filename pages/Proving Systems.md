- a statement
	- is
		- a proposition we want to prove
	- depends on
		- instance variables (public)
		- witness variables (private)
- what do we require of a proof?
	- completeness
		- there exists
			- an honest prover P
				- that can convince
					- the honest verifier V
				- of
					- any correct statement with high probability
	- soundness
		- even
			- a dishonest prover P
				- running in
					- super-polynomial time
						- cannot convince
							- an honest verifier V
						- of
							- an incorrect statement
		- note: P does not necessarily have to run in polynomial time, but V does
- to make our proof a [[zero knowledge proofs]] we also need [[zero knowledginess]]
	- to oversimplify
		- represented on a computer,
		- a ZKP is nothing more than a sequence of numbers, carefully computed by Peggy, together with a bunch of boolean checks that Victor can run in order to verify the proof of correctness for the computation
		- a zero knowledge protocol is thus the mechanism used for deriving these numbers and defining the verification checks
- interactive v noninteractive proofs
	- non-interactivity is only useful if we want to allow multiple independent verifiers to verify a given proof without each one having to individually query the prover
	- non-interactive zkp there is no repeated communication between prover and the verifier
		- instead, there is only a single 'roud' which can be carried out asynchronously
	- using publicly available data
		- peggy generates a proof, which she publishes in a place accessible to victor (.e. on a distributed ledger)
	- following this
		- victor can verify the proof at any point to complete the "round"
		- note that even though peggy produces a single proof, as opposed to multiple ones in the interactive version,
			- the verifier can still be certain that except for negligible probability, she does indeed know the secret she is claiming
- succinct v non succinct
	- succinctness is necessary only if the medium used for storing the proof is very expensive and/or if we need very short verification times
- proof v proof of knowledge
	- a proof of knowledge is stronger and more useful than just proving the statement is true
	- for instance, it allows me to prove that I know a secret key, rather than just that it exists
- argument v proof
	- in a proof, the soundness holds against a computationally unbounded prover
	- in an argument, the soundness only holds against a polynomially bounded prover.
	- arguments are thus often called 'computationally sound proofs'
	- the prover and verifier have to agree on what they're proving
	- this means that both know the statement that is sto be proven and what inputs to this statement represent
