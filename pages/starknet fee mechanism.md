- users can specify maximum fee that they are willing to pay for a transaction via the `max_fee` field
- only limitation on the [[sequencer]] enforced by [[starknet/os]] is the actual fee charged is bounded by `max_fee`, but for now, Starkware's sequencer will only charge the fee required to cover the [[proof]] cost (potentially less than the max fee)
- the sequencer only takes into account L1 costs involving proof submission
- there are two components affecting the L1 footprint of a transaction:
	- computational complexity: the heavier the transaction, the larger its portion in the proof verification cost
	- on chain data: l1 calldata cost originating from [[data availability]] and l2->l1 messages
- the fee is charged atomically with the transaction execution on l2. the starknet os injects a transfer of the fee-related ERC-20, with an amount equal to the fee paid, sender equals the transaction submitter, and the sequencer as a receiver
