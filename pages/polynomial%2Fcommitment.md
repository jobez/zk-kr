- "represents" a polynomial
- allows you to verify
	- [[polynomial/evaluation]] of that polynomial
		- without needing to actually contain
			- all of the data in the polynomial
	- that is
		- if
			- someone gives you a commitment `c` representing `P(x)`
				- they
					- can give
						- you
							- a proof that can convince you
								- for some specific `z`
									- what the value of `P(z)` is
		- there is a further mathematical result that says
			- that
				- over a sufficiently big field
					- if
						- certain kinds of equations about evaluated at random `z` are true
							- chosen before `z` is known
						- those same equations are true about the whole polynomial as well
- for example
	- if
		- `P(z) * Q(z) + R(z) = S(z) + 5` for a particular `z`
	- then
		- we know its overwhelmingly likely that
			- `P(x) * Q(x) + R(x) = S(x) + 5` for a particular `x` in general
- using such polynomial commitments
	- we
		- could very easily check
			- all of the above polynomial equations
				- make the commitments
					- use them as inputs to generate `z`
					- prove what the evaluations are of each polynomial at `z`
			- and
