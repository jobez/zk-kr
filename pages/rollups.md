- scaling solutions that have
	- transaction execution outside [[layer 1]]
	- transaction data and proof of transactions is on [[layer 1]]
	- a rollup smart contract in layer 1 that can enforce correct transaction execution on layer 2 by using transaction data on layer 1
	- the main chain
		- holds
			- funds
			- commitments
	- sidechain hold additional state and performs execution
	- there needs to be some proof, either a [[fraud proof]] or a [[validity proof]]
	- rollups require 'operators' to stake a bond in the rollup contract
		- this incentives operators to verify and execute transactions correctly
	- anyone can publish a batch
		- a collection of txns in a highly compressed form together with the previous state root and the new state root
			- the merkel root after processing the txns
		- the contract checks that the previous state root in the batch matches its current state root; if it does, it switches the state root to the new state root.
