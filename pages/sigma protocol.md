	- follows these three steps
		- [[commitment]]
			- the prover
				- generates a random number,
				- creates a commitment to that [[randomness]]
				- sends the commitment to the verifier
		- [[challenge]]
			- after getting the commitment
				- the verifier generates a random number as a challenge and sends it to the prover
			- it iis important that the verifier does not send the challenge before getting the commitment or else the prover can cheat
		- response
			- the prover takes the challenge and creates a response using the random number chosen in step 1, the challenge and the witness
			- the prover will then send the response to the verifier who will do some computation and will or will not be convinced of the knowledge of the witness
	- example [[Discrete Logarithm Problem]]
		- to prove knowledge of x in g^x = y without revealing x
			- the prover
				- generates a random number r
				- creates a commitment t = g^r and sends t to the verifier
				- sends t tto the verifier
			- the verifier stores t, generates a random challence c and sends it to the prover
			- the prover on receiving the challenge creates a response `s - r +x.c.` the prover sends this response to the verifier
			- the verifier can check that g^{s} equals y^{c}.t.
