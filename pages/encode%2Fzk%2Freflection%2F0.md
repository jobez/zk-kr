- It seems like groups as in [[Group Theory]] are used to give qualifications of [[polynomial]]s and [[finite field]]s .
	- Group theory is used in the construction of various cryptographic primitives, including those used in zero knowledge proofs.
		- Specifically, [[group]] s such as [[Elliptic Curves]] and cyclic groups are used in constructing the underlying cryptographic protocols.

- Finite fields over integers are relevant for zk and inform the nature of the inverse of division being different than how it would be over just integers.
	- [[Modular Arithmetic]]
	- Finite fields are also used in zero knowledge proofs, as they provide a mathematical structure for performing arithmetic operations over a finite set of numbers. This is important because many cryptographic primitives, including those used in zero knowledge proofs, rely on mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Finite fields also play a role in determining the structure of cryptographic protocols and in defining certain algebraic structures, such as rings and fields.
- It seems like understanding the relationship of the prime number in a finite field would help me begin to understand how general computation can be arithmetized.
	- When it comes to arithmetization of computation, finite fields are important for encoding the input and output of a computation as elements in the field.
	- This allows the computation to be expressed as a sequence of algebraic operations, such as addition and multiplication, that can be evaluated in the finite field.
		- A series of algebraic constraints can be expressed as a polynomial or a set of polynomials, depending on the specific computation being arithmetized.
	- The prime number in a finite field is crucial because it determines the size of the field, which in turn determines the range of possible inputs and outputs for a computation. By arithmetizing the computation in a finite field, it becomes possible to express the computation as a series of algebraic constraints that can be verified using zero knowledge proofs.
	- the size of the prime number that defines a finite field determines the number and nature of the roots of a polynomial over the field, and this information is crucial for many cryptographic applications, including zero knowledge proofs

		- the roots of a polynomial over a finite field are related to the prime number bounding of the field. In fact, the size of the finite field, which is determined by a prime number, plays a crucial role in determining the number and nature of the roots of a polynomial over the field.
		- In particular, for a finite field of size q, a polynomial of degree n over the field can have at most n distinct roots. This is known as [[[the fundamental theorem of algebra over finite fields]] Moreover, the roots of a polynomial over a finite field are contained within the field itself, so the number and nature of the roots are determined by the properties of the field.
			- For example, if the prime number p that defines the finite field has the property that p â‰¡ 1 (mod n), where n is the degree of the polynomial, then the polynomial has exactly n roots over the field.
				- This is known as [[the existence theorem for finite fields]]. On the other hand, if p does not satisfy this condition, then the polynomial may have fewer than n roots, and some of the roots may be repeated.
	- using a large prime number as the size of a finite field has utility for the ability to hide information, specifically in the context of cryptographic applications such as zero knowledge proofs
		- using a large prime number as the size of a finite field can provide additional security for cryptographic applications, including the ability to hide information in zero knowledge proofs
			- One reason for this is that using a large prime number as the size of a finite field can make it computationally difficult for an attacker to find the roots of a polynomial over the field. This is because computing the roots of a polynomial over a finite field is a hard problem, and the larger the size of the field, the more difficult it becomes. As a result, using a large prime number can make it harder for an attacker to determine information about the polynomial, such as the input and output values of a computation that have been encoded into the polynomial.
			- Another reason for using a large prime number is that it can make it more difficult for an attacker to guess the secret key used in a cryptographic scheme. This is because the larger the size of the field, the larger the space of possible secret keys, making it harder for an attacker to guess the correct key.
