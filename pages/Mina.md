- the first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain
  collapsed:: true
	- blockchain keeps size constant even as usage of the network grows
- what is needed for usable representation of the blockchain?
  collapsed:: true
	- a clear, usable representation of the basic data being queried of a state
		- account balances
	- data that a node needs in order to verify that this state is real in a trustless manner
	- the ability to broadcast transactions on the network to make a transfer
- roles
  collapsed:: true
	- block producer
		- akin to miners or stalkers in other protocols
			- by staking mina,
				- they can be selected to produce a block and earn rewards in the form of coinbase, transaction fees and network fees
				- block producers can decide to also be [[snarks]] producers
		- a block in mina is constituted of:
			- protocol state
				- genesis state hash
				- blockchain state
				- consensus state
				- consensus constants
			- protocol state proof
			- staged ledger diff
			- delta transition chain proof
			- current protocol version
			- proposed protocol version
	- snark worker
		- the second type of consensus node operator on mina,
			- snark producers help compress data in the network by generating SNARK proofs of transactions
			- they then sell those proofs to block producers in return for a portion of block rewards
	- professional block producer
		- because staking requires nodes to be online,
			- some may choose to delegate their mina to staking pools
			- these groups run staking services in exchange for a fee, which is automatically deducted when the delegator gets selected to be a block producer
- mina's consensus mechanism
  collapsed:: true
	- an implementation of ouroboros proof-of-stake
	- due to mina's unique compressed blockchain
		- certain aspects have diverged from the ourboros papers
		- the version mina uses is called [[ouroboros samisika]]
		- [[verifiable random functions]] are used to decide whether to produce a block, the probability is proportional to the producer's stake
- recursive composition of proof (succinctness)
  collapsed:: true
	- the blockchain is dynmaic and new blocks keep getting added to it.
	- as the blockchain grows
		- we compute a new SNARK proof that only validates new blocks, but also the existing SNARK proof itself
	- The notion of a SNARK proof that attests to the verifiability of another SNARK proof is the notion of“incrementally-computable SNARK”
- zkApps
  collapsed:: true
	- mina protocol's smart contracts that use [[off-chain execution]] and mostly off-chain state model
		- this allows for [[private computation]] and state that can be either private or public
	- client generates state updates / proof
		- network verifies proof x updates state on chain
		- [[on-chain verification]]
- zkApp use cases
  collapsed:: true
	- build privacy enabled apps
		- develop dapps that use zero knowledge to ensure data-level prviacy
			- verifying requirements without exposing underlying user information
	- power enterprise interoperability
		- use mina to combine the cost-efficiency and privacy of a private chain with the interoperability of a public chain
	- minimize transaction fees
		- power trustless e-commerce and global peer-to-peer transactions without using centralized intermediaries, or paying costly transaction fees
	- power secure and fair financial services
		- ensure lenders only use fair criteria to make decisions and securely verify relevant information w/o accessing private user data
	- enable private & auditable elections
		- guarantee fully verifiable and auditable elections, while keeping the process private and protecting individuals' voting invormation
	- access money from anywhere in the world
		- with a 22kb  mina chain, access to peer to peer stablecoins and tokens via smartphone and bring hard-earned money anywhere you go
- zkBridge ETH & WMina example
  collapsed:: true
	- the bridge is currently only one way
		- mina state can be read on ethereum, but not the other way around
	- how does the bridge work?
		- retrieve mina state proof and the [[verifying key]]
		- generate an auxilliary proof for the state received
		- post auxiliary proof to the ethereum blockchain, where a smart contract will update only if valid
		- eth: a wrapped mina contract on eth will be created which will be the minter.
			- this contract hs a mina address where a user will deposit funds into
		- mina: user deposits funds into address above on MINA blockchain
		- mina: deposit transaction gets committed
		- eth: auxiliary proof of mina state is submitted to ETH
		- eth: mina state proof is validated and confirmed
		- eth: wrapped mina contract is called which uses the proof and validates the balance and mints
- how mina creates proofs
  collapsed:: true
	- [[pickles]] and [[kimchi]]
	- program gets written with snarkyjs
	- snarky compiler produces verify solution
	- kimchi compiler updates prover index and verifier index
		- prover takes a public and private input and a proof (proof of correct execution)
		- verifier takes public input and proof, returns true or false
	- pickes has two components
		- core zk-snark
		- developer toolkit
			- containing
				- a wide array of library functionality
				- the Pickles Inductive Proof System
	- kimchi
		- based on the [[snarks/plonk]] family of [[snarks]] [[proof system]]s
			- one noteable improvement over plonk
				- is that
					- [[kimchi]] doesn't require a [[trusted setup]]
						- this is achieved by adding a [[polynomial/commitment]] to the setup
							- similar to [[bulletproofs]]
		- other improvements in kimchi
			- the gates used in the circuit have changed from being [[generic gates]] to specific gates to target known functionaltiy such as [[posiedon hashes]]
- [[Elliptic Curves]] used
	- mina uses curves [[Pallas]] and [[Vesta]]
- zkApps are written in typescript using [[snarkyjs]]
