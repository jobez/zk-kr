- a group
	- is
		- a set of elements plus a binary operation
	- must have certain properties
		- [[closure]]
			- for all a, b, in G
				- the result of the operation, a dot b, is also in G
		- [[associativity]]
			- for all a, b and c in G
				- (a dot b) dot c = a dot (b dot c)
		- identity element
			- there exists an element e in G such that
				- for every element a in G
					- the equation e dot a = e dot e = a holds
				- such an element is unique and speaks of the identity element
		- inverse element
			- for each a in G
				- there exists an element b in G
					- commonly denoted a^-1
					- such that
						- a dot b = b dot a = e
							- where e is the identity element
		- sub-groups
			- if
				- a subset of the elements in a group also satisfies the group properties, then that is a subgroup of the original group
		- cyclic groups and generators
			- a finite group can be cyclic
			- that means that it has a [[generator element]]
			- if you start at
				- any point
				- and then
					- apply the group operation with the generator as argument a certian number of times
						- you go around the whole group and end in the same place
- a [[field]] is an elaboration of a [[group]]
