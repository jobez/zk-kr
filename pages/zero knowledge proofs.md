- it is
	- difficult to find zero knowledge resources that avoid
		- the extremes of
			- over simplifying the structure
			- presenting so much mathematical detail that the reader gets bogged down and lose interest
- is
	- a proof that there exists or that we know something, plus a zero knowledge aspect
		- that is
			- the person verifying the proof only gains one piece of information that the proof is valid/invalid
		- the only way of showing someone i know the password is by giving them the password
- example
	- colour blind verifier
		- this is an interactive proof
			- showing that
				- the prover
					- can distinguish between
						- a red ball
						- and a green billiard ball
				- whereas
					- the verifier
						- cannot distinguish them
		- the prover wants to show the verifier that they have different colors but does not want him to learn which is red and which is green
