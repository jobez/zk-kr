- when we do a computation
	- break it into steps
- within a particular cpu
	- we will see that
		- a register will change from this value to an other value
		- a memory will change from this value to another value
- looking at all changes within cpu
- an encoded value of each program step
- is the execution trace like opcode sequences in EVM for instances?
	- it is more like a bunch of [[polynomial]] s, [[provable programs]] execute in a completely different way
