** [[interactive proofs]] and arguments are
*** [[cryptographic protocols]] that enable
**** an [[untrusted prover]]
***** to provide
****** a guarantee that
******* it performed a [[requested computation]] correctly
** introduced in the 1980s,
*** [[interactive proofs and arguments]]
**** represented
***** [[a major conceptual expansion of what constitutes a 'proof' that a statement is true]]
****** traditionally,
******* a [[proof]] is a [[static object]] that can easily checked [[step-by-step]] for [[correctness]]
****** in contract
******* [[interactive proofs]]
******** allow for
********* [[interaction]] between
********** [[prover]]
********** [[verifier]]
******** as well as
********* a tiny but nonzero probability that an invalid proof passes verification
******* [[arguments]] (but not [[interactive proofs]]) even permit there to be "proofs" of [[false statements]], so long as those proofs require [[exorbitant computational power]] to find
******* to an extent,
******** these notions mimic [[in-person interactions]] that mathematicians use to convince each other that a claim is true, without going through the painstaking process of writing out and checking a [[traditional static proof]]
****** celebrated theoretical results from 1980 and 1990s such as
******* IP = [[PSPACE]]
******* [[MIP]] equals [[NEXP]]
******* showed that, in principle,
******** suprisingly complicated statements can be proved efficiently
******** what is more, any [[argument]] can in principle be transformed into one that is [[zero-knowledge]], which means that
********* [[proofs reveal no information other than their own validity]]
********* [[zero knowledge arguments]] have a myriad of applications in [[cryptography]]
****** within the last decade,
******* [[general-purpose zero knowledge arguments]]
******** have made the jump from theory to practice
******* this has opened new doors in the design of cryptographic systems
******** and generated additional insight into the power of interactive proofs and arguments (zero knowledge or 
[[otherwise]] )
