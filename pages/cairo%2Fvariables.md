- can be
	- aliased
		- value reference `let a = 5`
		- expression reference `let a = x`
	- evaluated
		- temporary variable `tempvar a = 5 * b`
			- based on [[allocation pointer]] so it can be [[revoked]] due to [[jumps]] or function calls
			- is required when using `new` operator to reserve memory
			- can be used with variables that will change during a function such as a loop
			- can reduce the memory needed
		- local `local a = 5 * b`
			- requires `alloc_locals` statement
			- based on [[frame pointer]] so will not be revoked
			- note that unless the local variable is initialized in the same line, the local directive itself does not translate to a cairo instruction
				- this is another difference from `tempvar`--it simpy translates to a reference definition
					- this is one of the reasons you must increase the value of [[allocation pointer]] manually
		- constant `const a = 5`
