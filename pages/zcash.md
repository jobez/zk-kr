- is
	- an implementation of the Decentralized Anonymous Payment scheme
		- [[Zerocash]]
	- with security fixes and improvements to performance and functionality
- bridges
	- the existing transparent payment scheme used by [[Bitcoin]]
		- with
			- a shielded payment scheme
				- secured by
					- [[snarks]]
- attempted to address
	- the problem of mining centralization
		- by use of
			- the Equihash memory-hard proof of work algorithm

- overview
	- value in zcash is either
		- transparent
		- shielded
	- spend types
		- public
			- addresses starting w/ t
		- shielding
		- de-shielding
		- private
- [[trusted setup]]
	- in order
		- to ensure
			- the [[toxic waste]]
				- did not come into existence
	- our team designed [[multi-party computation]] protocols
		- which allowed
			- multiple independent parties
		- to collaboratively construct
			- the parameters
		- these protocols had the property that
			- in order to compromise
				- the final parameters
			- all of the participants would have had to be compromised or be dishonest
- ((64219cfb-00a7-4bcb-aadd-b7f1492fa48f))
	- an attack could have created fake Zcash without being detected
	- vulnerability around counterfeiting was so suble that it evaded years of analysis by expert cryptographers focused on zk proving systems and zk-snarks
-
- design
	- based on bitcoin
	- [[UTXO]] model
		- ((64219dc4-041f-4fec-8e0a-592458098401))
		- unspent transaction model
			- keep track of how many transactions havent been spent by a person
				- notes represent unspent transaction
					- balance is derived
			- alice
				- siigns
					- a transaction
						- to cancel Note1
						- and allow Bob
							- to create Note2 of the same value
			- zcash elaborates
				- to the note we add random value r as an identifier
				- rather than store these values directly, we store a hash of those values
				- in order to cancel the notes we introduce the notion of a [[nullifier]]
- the [[commitment]] / [[nullifier]] idea
	- commitment scheme
	  id:: 641c89f4-8a7d-4bcc-8d30-8d5f298d859a
		- is defined by algorithms
			- Commit
			- Open
		- given a message m and randomness r, compute as the output a value `c`
		- `c = Commit(m, r)`
		- a commitment scheme has 2 properties
			- binding
			- given a commitment c, it is hard to compute a different pair of message and randomness whose commitment is c
	- in zcash [[pedersen hash]]es are used to create the commitments using generator points on an [[Elliptic Curves]]
	- given a value v which we want commit ment to, and some random number r
		- commitment c = v * G_v + r * G_r
			- where G_v and G_r are generator points on an elliptic curve
	- nullifiers
		- are used to signal that a note has been spent
		- each note can deterministically produce a unique nullifier
		- when spending a note
			- the nullifier set is checked to ascertain whether that note has already been spent
			- if no nullifier exists for that note, the note can be spent
			- once the note has been spent its nullifier is added to the nullifier set
		- note that the nullifier is unlinkable, knowledge of a nullifier does not give knowledge of the note that produced it
			- preserves privacy of the system
	- shielded value is carried by notes
		- which specify
			- an amount and a shielded payment address
				- which is an address controlling the note
	- as in bitcoin
		- this is
			- associated with
				- a private key that can be used to spend notes sent to the adress
		- in zcash
			- this is called a [[spending key]]
- storing details of notes and nullifiers
	- to each note
		- there is cryptographically associated a note commitment
	- once
		- the transaction creating a note
			- has been
				- mined
	- the note
		- is associated with
			- a fixed note position in a tree of note commitments
	- an unspent valid note
		- at
			- a given point on the blockchain
		- is one for which
			- the note commitment has been publically revealed on the blockchain prior to that point, but the nullifier is not
	- for each shielded input
		- there is a revealed value commitment to the same value as the input note
		- if the value is nonzero, some revealed note commitment exists for this note
	- and for each shielded output
		- there is a revealed value commitment to the same value as the output note
		- the note commitment is computed correctly
		- it is infeasible to cause the nullifier of the output note to collide with the nullifier of any other note
