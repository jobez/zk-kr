	- [[pedersen hash]] can be seen as a [[commitment]]
	- a [[cryptographic commitment scheme]] lets you keep a piece of data secret but commit to it so you can't change it later
		- a simple commitment scheme can be constructed using a cryptographic hash
			- commitment = hash(blinding_factor || data)
	- if you tell someone only the commitment then they cannot determine what data you are commiting to
		- given certain assumptions about the properties of the hash)
			- but
			- u can later reveal both the data and the blinding factor and they can run the hash and verify that the data you committed to matches
		- the blinding factor is present because w/o one
			- someone
				- could try guessing at the data
					- if
						- your data is small and simple
						- it might be easy to just guess it and compare the guess to the commitment
