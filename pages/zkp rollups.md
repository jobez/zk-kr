- scheme consists of two types of users
	- [[transactor]] and [[relayer]]
		- transactors :: create their transfer and broadcast the transfer to the network
			- the transfer data consists of
				- an indexed to and from address
				- a value to transact
				- the network fee
				- nonce
			- a shortened 3 byted indexed version of the addresses reduces processing resource needs
			- the value of the txn being greater than or less than zero creates a deposit or withdrawal respectively
			- the smart contract records the data in two merkel trees
				- addresses in one merkle tree and transfer amounts in another
		- relayers
			- collect a large amount of tranfers to create a rollup
			- job of relayers to generate a [[snarks]] proof
				- the snark proof is a hash that represents the delta of the blockchain state
				- state refers to 'state of being'
			- snark proof compares
				- the snapshot of the blockchain before the transfers
				- a snapshot of the blockchain after the transfers
			- reports only the changes in a verifiable hash to the mainnet
			- anyone can become a relayer so long as they have staked the required bond in the smart contract
