	- can be viewed as a generalization of [[functional languages]]
		- everything is [[referentially transparent]] and side-effect free
		- there is no ordering of constraints
		- composing two r1cs programs just means that their constraints are simultaneously satisfied
			- https://coders-errand.com/constraint-systems-for-zk-snarks/
	- the important thing to understand
		- is that
			- a r1cs
				- is not
					- a computer program
	- you
		- are not asking it
			- to produce
				- a vaue from certain inputs
	- it is more of a verifier
		- it shows that an already complete computation is correct
	- the [[arithmetic circuit]]
		- is a composition of
			- multiplicative sub-circuites
				- and
					- a single multiplication gate
					- multiple addition gates
	- a rank 1 constraint system
		- is
		  collapsed:: true
			- a set of these sub-circuits
				- expressed as
					- [[constraints]]
						- each of the form
							- AXB = C
								- where
									- A, B, C
										- are each linear combbinations
											- c1*v1+c2*v2+ ...
												- the c_i are constant field elements
								- doesn't mean that C is computed from A and B, just that A, B, C are consistent
									- more generally
										- an implementation of `x = f(a, b)`
											- doesn't mean that
												- x is computed from a and b
													- just that
														- x, a, and b are consistent
		- thus our r1cs constins
			- the constant 1
			- all public inputs
			- outputs of the function
			- private inputs
			- auxillary variables
		- has
			- one constraint per gate
			- one constraint per circuit output
	- example
		- assume peggy wants to prove to victor that she knows
			- c1, c2, c3
				- such that
					- (c1 * c2) * (c1 + c3) = 7
						- we transform the expression above into an arithmetic circuit depicted below
