	- initially used [[ring signatures]]
	- later moved to using [[bulletproofs]]
- overview
	- [[commitment]]s to inputs are used to shield input details
	- we need to show that
		- the sum of inputs and outputs add up
	- but
		- there
			- is
				- a potential problem w/ overflow since we work on a finite field
	- this is solved w/ [[range proofs]]
		- to show that
			- the values are in the correct range w/o revealing the values
- monero comment on their move to bullet proofs
	- w/ our current range proofs
		- the txn is around 13.2 kb in size
		- if i used single-output bullet proofs
			- the transaction reduces in size to only around 2.5 kb
	- this is approx an 80% reduction in transaction size, which then translates to an 80% reduction in fees as well
	- the space savings are even better w/ multiple-output proofs
	- this represents a significant decrease in txn sizes
	- further, our initial testing shows that the time to verify a bulletproof is lower than the existing range proofs, meaning speedier blockchain validation
