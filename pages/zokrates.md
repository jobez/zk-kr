- the creator writes and compiles a program in the zokrates dsl
	- the creator / prover generates a trusted setup for the compiled program
	- the prover computes a witness for the compiled program
	- the prover generates a proof
		- using the proving key
			- she generates a proof for
				- a computation of the compiled program
	- the creator/prover exports a verifier
		- using the verifying key
			- she generates a Solidity contract which contains
				- the generated verification key and a public function
					- to verify
						- a solution to the compiled program
- the program checks if the prover knows what it claims to know
	- C creates proof
	- verifier in solidity consumes proof and returns yes / or
- parameters of system
	- scheme
	- curve
