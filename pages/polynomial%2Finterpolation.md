- [[Lagrange Interpolation]]
- in [[zero knowledge proofs]] systems
	- particular those based on [[polynomial/commitment]] (e.g. [[snarks]] )
		- polynomials
			- are used for
				- ((6428526c-84ea-48d1-b52a-2fb7e9ebd9e0))
		- through interpolation
			- it
				- is possible to construct
					- a [[polynomial]] that passes through a given set of points
						- effectively encoding the [[information]] contained in those points
		- polynomial interpolation
			- can be used to represent
				- ((6428526c-84ea-48d1-b52a-2fb7e9ebd9e0))
			- while
				- preserving certain privacy and secority properties
