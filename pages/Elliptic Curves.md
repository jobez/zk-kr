- certain equations of elliptic curves will satisfy [[Group Theory]]'s axioms
	- every 2 points can be added to give a third point [[closure]]
	- it does not matter in what order the two points are added [[commutativity]]
	- if you have more than two points to add, it doesn't matter which ones you add first either [[associativity]]
	- there is an identity element
