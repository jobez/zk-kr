- a field is
	- a set of say integers with two operations called addition and multiplication
	- a set with operations that satisfies
		- [[associativity]]
		- commutativity of addition and multiplication
		- additive and multiplcative identity
		- additive inverses
		- multiplicative inverses
			- for every a not zero in F
				- there exists an element in F, denoted by a^-1 called the multiplicative inverse of a, such that a^-1 =1
		- distributivity of multiplication over addition
- a [[finite field]] is an elaboration of a field
