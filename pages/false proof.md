- the probability of accepting a [[false proof]]
  id:: 6428a1e3-b0f5-4863-be72-be983f5bd1a4
	- is less than
		- 10.d/p
			- if p is a certain size 2^256
			- and the degree of the polynomial d
	- if the finite field has a large size (about 2^256), this probability becomes very small
		- around 2^-230 for a polynomial of degree 10^6
			- making it extremely unlikely for a verifier to accept a false proof
	- #gpt/4 combing the concepts of
		- ((64289696-3be9-4f6a-a832-cd69a4671a11))
			- ensures that
				- the difference between correct and incorrect statements is large, making it easier to detect a [[false proof]]
			- the larger
				- the difference between the true and false statements
			- the less likely it is for
				- a false proof to be accepted
		- [[Schwartz-Zippel Lemma]]
			- provides
				- an upper bound
					- on
						- the [[probability]]
							- that
								- a non-zero polynomial
									- evaluates to zero
										- at
											- a randomly chosen point
			- this bound
				- is given by
					- d / |S|
						- where
							- d is the degree of the polynomial
							- |S| is the size of the set from which the random point is chosen
			- in the context of [[zero knowledge proofs]]
				- this lemma
					- helps establish
						- the probability of error
							- when using
								- polynomial-based representations
				-
		- we can see that
			- the probability of accepting a false proof
				- is
					- small
				- when
					- the field size is large
					- the degree of the polynomial is relatively small
	- #gpt/4 the intution behind this probability
		- is that
			- if
				- a prover tries to cheat and provide false polynomial evaluations
			- they
				- would need to construct
					- polynomials
						- that
							- satisfy
								- the constraints at a random point `z`
									- chosen by
										- the [[verifier]]
