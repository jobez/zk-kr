	- [[trusted setup]]
		- zksnarks require a one off setup to produce prover and verifier keys
		- this step is generally seen as a drawback to zksnarks
			- it requires an amount of [[trust]]
			- if details of the setup are later leaked it would be possible to create false proofs
	- a high level description is turned into an [[arithmetic circuit]]
		- the creator of the zksnark
			- uses
				- a high level language
					- to specify
						- the algorithm
							- that
								- constitutes and tests the [[proof]]
		- this high level specificiation is compiled into an arithmetic circuit
		- the circuit constrains the allowed inputs that will lead to a correct proof
			- if these constraints will hold, then our proof is correct
	- further mathematical refinement
		- the circuit
			- is then turned into
				- a [[r1cs]]
			- and then
				- a series of formulae called
					- a [[QAD]]
			- the end result
				- is
					- a proof in the form of series of bytes
						- that
							- is given to
								- the [[verifier]]
				- the verifier
					- can pass
						- this proof
							- through
								- a verifier function
									- to receive
										- a true or false result
			- there
				- is
					- no information
						- in
							- the proof
								- that
									- the verifier
										- can use to learn
											- any further information
												- about
													- the prover or their witness
