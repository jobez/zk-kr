	- formulation of the QAP
- ((6428c03c-ba26-40a9-aa1c-3794b91fcb53))
	- the next step
		- is taking this [[r1cs]] and
			- converting it into QAP form
				- which implements
					- the exact same logic
						- except using
							- [[dot products]]
								- instead of
									- a[[polynomial]]
	- to create the polynomials
		- we can use
			- [[polynomial/interpolation]] of the values in our [[r1cs]]
		- then
			- instead of
				- checking the constraints in the R1CS individually
					- we
						- can now check
							- all of the constraints at the same time
								- by doing
									- the dot product check on the polynomials
	- because in this case
		- the [[dot product check]]
			- is
				- a series of additions and multiplications of polynomials
		- the result is itself going to be a polynomial
	- if
		- the resulting polynomial
			- evaluated at
				- every x coordinate
					- that
						- we use above
							- to represent
								- a logic gate
			- is
				- equal to zero
	- then
		- that
			- means
				- that
					- all of the checks pass
	- if
		- the resulting polynomial
			- evaluated at
				- at least one of the x coordinate representing a logic gate gives a nonzero value
		- then
			- that
				- means
					- that
						- the values going into and out of that logic gate are
							- [[inconsistent]]
