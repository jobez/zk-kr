- is
	- an expression
		- that
			- can be built from
				- constants and variables
					- by means of
						- addition, multiplication, and exponentiation to a non-negative integer power

		- for example, consider the A(x) + B(x) = C(x)
			- if this equation is true, then its also true that
				- A(0)+B(0)=C(0)
- have
	- roots
		- a polynomial p of a single variable x in a field K and with coefficients in that field
			- the root r of P is an element K such that P(r) = 0
			- B is said to divide another polynomial A when the later can be written as BC
- in zkps
	- if a [[prover]]
		- claims to know
			- some polynomial (no matter how large its degree is) that the verifier also knows
	- they can follow a simple protocol to verify the statement
		- [[verifier]]
			- chooses a random value for ex and evaluates his polynomial locally
			- gives x to the prover and asks to evaluate the polynomial in question
		- [[prover]]
			- evaluates her polynomial at x and gives the result to the verifier
		- [[verifier]]
			- checks if the local result is equal to the prover's result, and if so then the statement is proven with a high confidence

- what does it mean to say that 2 polynomials are equal?
	- they evaluate to the same value at all points
	- they have the same coefficients
- if we are working with real numbers, these two points would be simultaneous
	- not the case with [[finite field]]s
- for example, all elements of a field size q satisfy the identity
	- x field size q = x
		- the polynomials xq and X take the same values at all points, but do not have the same coefficients
