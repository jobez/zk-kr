- an open source layer 2 network bringing scalabity and privacy to Ethereum
	- uses [[snarks]] to provide privacy and scaling via our zkrollup service
- terms
	- privacy :: all aspects of a transaction remain hidden from the public or third parites
	- confidentiality :: the inputs and outputs of a transaction are hidden from the public but the transaction parties remain public
	- anonymity ::  the inputs and outputs of a transaction are public but the transaction graph is obscured from one transaction to the next, preventing the identification of the transacttion parties
- aztec follows a [[UTXO]] model similar to btc and zcash
	- the core of any aztec transaction is a note
	- the state of notes are managed by a note registry for any given asset
	- aztec protocol does not represent value like a traditional balance, which maps owners to how much they own
	- the user's balance of any aztec asset is made up the sum of all the valid notes their address owns in a note registry
	- an aztec note owner can spend in a join-split style of confidential transaction
		- in this txn
			- the note owner will destroy some unspent aztec notes they own
			- in their place, they will create a set of new notes
				- the sum of the new notes must be equal to the sum of the values of old notes
- a join split transaction
	- suppose alice has a cluster of notes summing to 100zkdia and wants to send 75 zkdai to bob
	- alice takes notes of size 60 zkdai and 40 zkdai (input notes, she needs both)
	- aztec txns need to be confidential, so the zero-sum is zkp via the homomorphic additive property of elliptic curves
	- alice would create an AZTEC zkp that proves this relationship in zk
		- alice does not reveal to anybody how much the notes are actually worth, just that the balancing relationship holdes
	- the aztec token smart contract will then
		- validate this zkp
		- destroy alice's input notes
		- create the output notes in its note registry
	- when alice is creating bob's notes
		- she constructs note viewing keys that bob will be able to identify, via a non-interactive secret-sharing protocol
		- bob is dependent on alice to act trustfully in this regard and not provide viewing keys that can be decoded by observers
		- this is already implicitly required
			- after all
				- Alice could broadcast to the world how much she is sending bob if she did not want the txn to be confidential
		- to achieve interoperability with other DApps,
			- all AZTEC assets share a common trusted setup and their state is managed by a single smart contract, the AZTEC cryptography engine or ACE
- anonymity
	- aztec notes have owners defined by ethereum addresses
	- on the surface, ownership is not anonymous
	- the aztec protocol includes a monero-style stealth address protocol to derive ethereum addresses that are single use and cannot be linked to any other ethereum addresses
		- e.g. if you have an aztec wallet, i can send a note to an eth address you control, but nobody but you and me will know this is the case
	- the protocol supports both stealth addresses
		- which require a specific wallet to work
			- you need two public/private key pairs so a regular ethereum account wont work
			- regular ethereum addresses (which are not anonymous, if you own a note everyone will be able to see that)
