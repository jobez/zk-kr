- the efficient evaluation of polynomials at different points is an essential operation in many [[zero knowledge proofs]] systems
- fast polynomial evaluation techniques
	- such as
		- [[Fast Fourier Transformation]]
	- can help reduce
		- the computational complexity of ZKP operations
			- which is crucial for
				- making ZKP's practical in real world applications
