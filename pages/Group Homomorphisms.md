- a homomorphism is
	- a map between two algebraic structures of the same type
		- that
			- preserves the operations of the structures
	- this means a map f: A -> B between groups A, B equipped with the same structure such that
	- if dot is an operation of the structure (here a binary operation), then
		- f(x dot y) = f(x) dot f(y)
