- how does dark forest use snarks?
- a central mechanisc in dark forest is -> fog of war
	- fog of war ensures that you don't automatically know where all players, planets, and other points of interest are in the universe
	- you have to spend computational resources to discover them
	- this mechanic is secured by [[snarks]]
- in a universe w/ a fog of war
	- the locations of all players are private and hidden from each other
	- this means that players don't upload the coordinates of their planets to the ethereum blockchain, which can be publicly inspected
	- instead, each player uploads the hash of their location to the blockchain
	- this ensures that players stay "committed" to a specific location, but also that the location can't be determined from inspection of the ethereum data layer
- without zkstarks
	- there's an obvious attack player
		- if
			- a player uploads a random string of bytes that doesnt correspond to a real and valid location
			- the [[integrity]] of the game is broken
- to prevent this,
	- dark forest requires players to submit zk snarks with every move
		- to ensure that
			- players are indeed submitting hashes corresponding to valid coordinates that they have knowledge of
- when players make moves
	- they're also required to submit ZK proofs that their moves are "valid"
		- you can't move too far or too fast
	- w/o zksnarks
		- a malicious player could make illegal teleport moves
			- by claiming that
				- the hash they are moving from is next to the hash they're moving to
					- even if the two locations are actually on opposite sides of the universe
- once again, requiring zk proofs keep players honest
- to use a chess analogy
	- the required zk proofs basically tell the contract
		- im moving my knight
		- i'm not going to tell you where i moved my knight from or where I moved it to
		- but this proof proves that it did in fact move in a legal L-shape
