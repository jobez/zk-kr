	- [[zcash]] explanation
		- snarks require something called the [[public parameters]]
		- the snark public parameters
			- are
				- numbers with a specific cryptographic structure
					- that
						- are known to all of the participants in the system
		- they
			- are baked into
				- and
					- the protocol
					- the software
				- from
					- the beginning
		- the obvious way to construct snark [[public parameters]]
			- is just to have
				- someone
					- generate
						- a public/private keypair
							- similar to
								- an [[ECDSA]] keypair
					- then destroy
						- the [[private key]]
			- the problem is that private key
			- anybody who gets a copy of it can use it to counterfeit money
				- however, it cannot violate any user's privacy
					- the privacy of transactions
						- is not at risk from this
			- zcash used a [[secure multiparty computation]]
				- in which
					- multiple people each generate
						- a "shard" of the public/private keypair
						- then
							- they
								- each destroy their shard of the [[toxic waste]] [[private key]]
						- and then
							- they
								- all bring together
									- their shareds of the public key
										- to form
											- the snark public paratemers
				- if that process works
					- i.e. if atleast one of the participants
						- successfully destroyed their private key shard
					- then
						- the toxic waste byproduct
							- never comes into existence
								- at all
