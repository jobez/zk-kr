- [[StarkEx]] has a [[prover]] that performs large computations off-chain and produces a [[STARK]]
	- the [[constraints]] for this first deployment were handwritten by starkware's engineers, thus greatly limiting feature velocity for starkex
	- we concluded that a programming language to support general computation is needed -> [[cairo]]
- cairo
	- in the summer of 2020 made its first appearance on ethereum mainnet
	- cairo stands for [[Algebraic Intermediate Representation]]
		- includes a single AIR that veriies the instruction set of this [[cairo/cpu]]
		- it opened the foor for coding proofs for more complex business logic, for arbitrary computaitonal systems, and doing so for in a faster and safer manner
	- a cairo program can prove the execution of a single applications logic
		- but a cairo program can also be a concatenation of mutliple such applications [[SHARP]]
