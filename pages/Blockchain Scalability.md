- potential solutions
	- on chain l1 solutions
		- [[consensus mechanism]]
		- [[sharding]]
- off chain scaling (layer 2)
	- transactions are submitted to these [[layer 2]] nodes instead of being submitted directly to [[layer 1]]
		- for some solutions
			- the layer 2 instance then batches them into groups before anchoring them to layer 1
				- after which they are secured by layer 1 and cannot be altered
			- a specific layer  2 instance may be open and shared by many applications, or may be deployed by one project and dedicated to supporting only their application
