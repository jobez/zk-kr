	- [introducing plonky2](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-plonky2)
	- allows us to speed [[proving times]]
		- that don't involve recursion
	- with [[FRI]]
		- you can either have
			- fast proofs that are big
				- so they are more expensive to verify on [[Ethereum]]
			- slow proofs that are small
	- constructions that use FRI
		- like
			- the [[STARK]]s that [[StarkWare]] uses in their [[zkp rollups]]
				- have to choose
	- they cant have maximlally fast proving times and proof sizes that are small enough to reasonably verify on ethereum
	- plonky2 eliminates this tradeoff
		- in the case where [[proving times]] matter
			- we can optimize for maximally fast proofs
		- when these proofs are recursively aggregated
			- we're left with a single proof that can be verified in a small circuit
				- at this point
					- we can optmize for [[proof size]]
						- we can shrink our proof sizes down to 45kb with only 20s of proving time
							- not a big deal since we generate when we submit to ethereum
								- dramatically reducing costs relative to [[StarkWare]]
	- plonky is natively compatible with [[Ethereum]]
		- plonky2 requires only [[keccak-256]] to verify a proof
		- we've estimated that the [[gas cost]] to verify a plonky2 size-optiimzied proof on ethereum will be approximately 1 million gas
	- however
		- this cost
			- is donimated by the [[calldata]] costs to publish the proof on ethereum
			- since calldata was repriced in EIP-448
				- the verification cost of a plonky2 proof has dropped between 170-200k gas
					- which could make it not only the fastest proving system, but also the cheapest to verify ethereum
