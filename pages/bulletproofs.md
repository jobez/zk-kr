- have
	- short proofs without a trusted setup
	- underlying cryptographic assumption
		- is
			- [[Discrete Logarithm Problem]]
- made non interactive
	- using
		- [[Fiat-Shamir heuristic]]
- designed to provide
	- confidential transactions for cryptocurrencies
- support [[proof aggregation]]
	- so that
		- proving that m transaction values are valid
			- adds only
				- O(log(m)) additional elements to the size of a single proof
- pederson [[commitment]]s are used for the inputs
- they do not require any pairings and work with any elliptic curve with reasonably large subgroup size
- the verifier cost scales linearly with the computatio size
- were based on the ideas of [[groth16]] snarks but changed various aspects
	- they give a more compact version of the inner product argument of knowledge
	- allow construction of a compact rangeproof using such an argument of knowledge
	- they generalize this idea to general arithmetic circuits
- some use cases for bulletproofs
	- [[range proofs]]
	- [[merkle proofs]]
	- [[proof of solvency]]
