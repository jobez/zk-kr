  collapsed:: true
	- summary #gpt/4
		- zk proving systems
			- involves
				- a [[prover]]
				- a [[verifier]]
			- engages in
				- a protocol involving polynomials and their evaluations
					- to convince
						- the verifier
							- of
								- the truth of a [[statement]] `s`

- steps
  collapsed:: true
	- [[prover]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- claims
			- [[statement]] `S`
		- #gpt/4 the [[prover]] wants to convince the [[verifier]]
			- that
				- a certain statement s is true
					- without revealing
						- any additional information
			- this statement could represent
				- a complex relationship
				- a function
				- or some kind of constraint
	- [[verifier]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- provides
			- some [[constraints]] about the polynomials
		- #gpt/4 the [[verifier]] specifies
			- constraints
				- that
					- the [[prover]] must satisfy to prive the statement `s`
			- the [[constraints]] are usually defined in terms of [[polynomial constraints]]
	- [[prover]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- provides or commits to
			- `P_i ... P_k` polynimals
		- #gpt/4 the prover constructs
			- polynomials
				- that
					- satisfy the verifier's constraints
				- and either
					- provides them directly
					- commits to them
						- using a [[cryptographic commitment scheme]]
	- [[verifier]]
		- provides
			- z âˆˆ 0,..p-1
		- only randomness we use here is sampling z
			- in general the [[randomness]] we use in the process
				- is essential for
					- both [[succinctness]] and [[zero knowledginess]]
		- #gpt/4 the verifier selects a random value `z`
			- from
				- the [[finite field]] F_p (with elements from 0 to p-1)
			- and sends it to
				- the [[prover]]
	- [[prover]]
		- provides
			- evaluation of polynomials
				- P_1(z)... P_k(z)
			- #gpt/4 the prover evaluates the polynomials at the point z and provides their evaluations to the verifier
	- [[verifier]]
		- decides whether to accept `S`
- ((6428a1e3-b0f5-4863-be72-be983f5bd1a4))
- Why doesn't the verifier evaluate the polynomials themselves?
	- because
		- the prover
			- doesn't actually send
				- all the polynomials
			- to
				- the verifier
	- if
		- they did
	- we would lose [[succinctness]]
	- they
		- contain
			- more information
		- than
			- our original statement
	- so
		- the prover
			- just provides
				- a [[polynomial/commitment]]
