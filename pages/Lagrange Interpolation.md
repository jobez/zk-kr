	- if you have a set of points then
		- doing a Lagrange proposition on those points
			- gives you
				- a polynomial that passes through all those points
	- if
		- you have
			- two points on a plane
		- you can define
			- a single straight line that passes through both
	- for three points
		- a single 2nd-degree curve will go through them
			- `5x^2 + 2x + 1`
				- will go through them
	- for n points
		- you can create an n-1 degree polynomial that will go through all of the points
