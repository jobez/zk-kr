- in a proof of replication
	- a storage miner
		- proves that
			- they are storing a physically unique copy or replica of the data
	- happens just once, at the time the data is first stored by the miner
	- run once to prover that a miner stored a physically unique copy of the data at the time the sector was sealed
- proof of space time
	- ran repeatedly to prove that
		- they are continuing to dedicate storage space to that same data over time
- both these proofs use zk-snarks for compression
- the process of creating filecoin's zk-snarks is computationally expensive (slow)
- but the resulting end product is small and the verification process is very fast
- compared to the original proofs, zk-snarks are tiny, making them efficient to store in a blockchain
- for example, a proof that would have taken up hundreds of kilobytes on the filecoin chain can be compressed to just 192 bytes using a zk [[snarks]]
- for storage to be verified on filecoin
	- two proofs are involved
		- proof of replication
			- a storage provider proves that they are storing a unique copy of a piece of data or information
			- each that goes on-chain includes 10 individual snarks, which together prove that the process was done correctly through probabilistic challenges
		- proof of spacetime
			- serves to prove that the storage provider continues to store the original data over time without manipulation or corruption
			- when a storage provider first agrees to store data for a client, they must put down collateral in the form of FIL
			- if
				- at any point during the agreement the provider fails to prove POSt
				- they are penalized and can lose all or some of their posted FIL collateral
	- the result of an on-chain interaction
		- in which
			- the [[prover]] and [[verifier]]
				- agree that
					- data has been stored and maintained in an appropriate manner is a [[proof]]
	- as mentioned above,
		- without
			- a solution to make these proofs small and efficient
		- they
			- would take up
				- a tremendous amount of the network's bandwidth
			- deliver
				- high operational costs to both storage providers and miners
		- by using
			- zk snarks
			- to generate
			- the proofs
			- the resulting proofs are small and the verification process is fast (and thus cheap)
			- for example
				- proofs that typically would require hundreds of kilobytes to verify can instead be compressed to just 192 bytes with zk-snarks
				- as mentioned above, each proof of representation includes 10 snarks
					- meaning 1920 bytes in each (10 by 192 bytes)
