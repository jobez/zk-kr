- roots
	- a polynomial p of a single variable x in a field K and with coefficients in that field
		- the root r of P is an element K such that P(r) = 0
		- B is said to divide another polynomial A when the later can be written as BC
		- if one root r of a polynomial P(x) of degree n
			- is known then
				- polynomial long division
					- can be used to factor P(x)
						- into
							- the form `(x - r)(Q(x))`
								- where
									- Q(x) is a polynomial of degree n-1
									- Q(x) is simply the quotient obtained from the division process, since r is known to be a root of P(x), it is known that the remainder must be zero
