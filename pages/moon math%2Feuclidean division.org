* integers can be
** added
** subtracted
** multiplied
** result of these operations is guaranteed to always be an integer as well
* however, it is always possible to divide any two integers if we consider *division with a remainder*
* for example
** 7 divided by 3 is equal to 2 with a remainder of 1
*** since
**** 7 = 2* 3 + 1
* this section introduces division with a remainder for integers, usually called [[euclidean division]]
* let a be a member of integers Z
** then there is always another integer m and a natural number r with r being less than or equal to zero which is less than or equal to the absolute value of b
*** such that
**** the following holds
***** a = m * b + r
****** a is called the dividend
****** m is called the quotient
****** b is called the divisor
****** r is called the remainder
* a `div` b := m
* a `mod` b := r
* one of the most critical parts of this book is the [[Modular Arithmetic]] and its application in the computations of [[prime fields]]
** to be able to do computations in modular arithmetic
*** we have to get familiar with the so called [[extended euclidean algorithm]] used to calculate the [[greatest common divisor]] of integers
* [[coprime integers]]
