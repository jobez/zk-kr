- modular arithmetic
	- working w/ the following set of integers S = {0, 1,2,3,4,5,6}
		- 4 + 4 = (4+ 4) mod 7 = 8 mod 7 = 1
		- 3 x 5 = 15 mod 7 = 1
		- inverse of 3
			- 3x = 1 (mod 7)
				- least positive residue is 5
	- for S = {0, 1, 2,3,4,5,6}
		- can we consider S and the operation '+' to be a [[group]]?
			- ((640f5bcc-5f68-4581-b500-6f0f12f56cdc))
				- closure
					- the set is closed under addition since
						- if a and be are elements in the set
						- then a + b is also an element in the set
				- associativity
					- addition is associative
				- identity
					- there exists an identity element for addition: zero
					- for any element a in the set a + 0 = 0 + a = a
				- inverse element
					- not every element in the set has an inverse under addition
					- there is no element x in the set such that 2 + x = 0
	- what is -13 mod 5?
		- -13 mod 5 = (-13 % 5 + 5) % 5
		- (-3 + 5) % 5 = 2
- for the polynomial x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12
	- positive root:  2
	- degree of polynmial -> coefficient of highest degree term -> 3
- use cases
	- any systems that you have used that involved zk proofs
		- cairo
	- have you seen any applications of zero knowledge proofs other than with a blockchain?
	- what is to you, the most important feature of zkp technology?
		- extending crypto from denotations of obscured identities to denotations of state machines
	- think of some use cases of zkps that you would like to see developed
		- linking stakeholders of things used for training ml models to users of model
		- allowing the discovery of connections of two datums with respect to an ml model such that the two datums do not disclose their denotation without owners discretion
